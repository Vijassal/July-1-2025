- ✅ User type registrations: Users can manage their own types
- ✅ Account creation requests: Professionals can create, users can view their requests

### 5. User Story Compliance

#### **Case 1: Jake & Julie (Regular Users)** ✅
- ✅ Jake registers → Account instance automatically created
- ✅ Jake can invite Julie to his account (existing functionality preserved)
- ✅ Both users can access the same account instance

#### **Case 2: Brenda (Professional User)** ✅
- ✅ Brenda can register as professional user
- ✅ Brenda can create account requests for clients
- ✅ Brenda can access multiple client accounts
- ✅ Real data integration in professional dashboard

#### **Case 3: Vendor User** ✅
- ✅ Vendor profiles table exists and properly secured
- ✅ Vendor access is limited to their own profile
- ✅ Ready for future vendor-specific features

#### **Case 4: Jenny (User Type Transition)** ✅
- ✅ User type registration system in place
- ✅ Account instances are preserved during transitions
- ✅ Professional access system ready for multi-account access

## Conclusion

The architectural fixes have successfully addressed all the critical issues identified in the audit:

2. ✅ **Implemented proper account instance creation**
3. ✅ **Standardized RLS policies**
4. ✅ **Added professional multi-account support**
5. ✅ **Preserved all existing functionality**

The platform now has a robust, scalable, and secure architecture that properly supports all user types and use cases while maintaining the existing user experience.

## 1. Database Cleanup
- Unused tables and duplicate fields were removed.
- Schema inconsistencies were resolved.
- The `is_active` column was added to `professional_account_access`.
- Remaining tables were confirmed to match the intended design.

## 2. SaaS Subscription System
- Subscription system implemented for Regular, Professional, and Vendor users.
- Tables created/updated: `subscription_plans`, `user_subscriptions`, `subscription_usage`, `payment_webhooks`.
- Columns added/updated in `account_instances` and `user_type_registrations`.
- Functions created/updated: `create_trial_subscription`, `upgrade_user_subscription`, etc.
- Fixed ambiguous variable errors in PL/pgSQL functions.
- RLS policies and indexes are in place for all subscription-related tables.

## 3. Data Integrity and Multi-Tenancy
- All business entity tables now include `account_instance_id` for tenant isolation.
- RLS policies updated to enforce tenant data isolation.
- Data integrity and migration scripts were run as needed.

## 4. Error Handling and Idempotency
- All errors encountered during script runs were addressed (ambiguous columns, missing columns, existing policies).
- Scripts are idempotent and safe to re-run.

## 5. Architecture Consistency
- Centralized account and subscription logic.
- All business logic and RLS policies are consistent with the architecture summary.
- Database types and application code updated as needed.

## 6. Next Steps/Optional
- Maps system tables can be run if needed.
