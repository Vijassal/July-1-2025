-- ============================================================================
-- FINAL SUMMARY
-- ============================================================================

/*
DATA INTEGRITY FIXES COMPLETED:

✅ ADDED ACCOUNT_INSTANCE_ID TO:
- vendors, budgets, blueprints, destinations, sub_events
- seating_arrangements, seating_tables, seating_assignments
- transportation_vehicles, transportation_assignments
- rsvp_questions, rsvp_responses
- chat_rooms, chat_messages, chat_participants, chat_notifications
- vendor_booking_links, vendor_bookings
- exchange_rates, logged_item_costs, logged_payments

✅ MIGRATED EXISTING DATA:
- Linked existing records to proper account instances
- Maintained data relationships through foreign keys

✅ CREATED COMPREHENSIVE RLS POLICIES:
- Account owners can manage their data
- Professionals can manage accessible account data
- Proper data isolation enforced

✅ CREATED PERFORMANCE INDEXES:
- Composite indexes on (account_instance_id, created_at)
- Optimized for multi-tenant queries

✅ VALIDATED DATA INTEGRITY:
- Checked for orphaned records
- Ensured proper account scoping

RESULT: Complete multi-tenant data isolation with proper security and performance.
